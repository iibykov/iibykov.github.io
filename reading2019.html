As part of the theoretical part on project and product management, the current state of the Scrum methodology and the foundations of Kanban are described. The practical part is devoted to business modeling, requirements management, requirements analytics, team management, timing, risk management, engineering development practices (mostly from extreme programming), quality control and assurance, Scrum implementation and scaling.<br/>

						Dozens of various achievements - and one name on all diplomas. Sales, management, business, consulting, books - and one person. Of course, in each field, their own professional skills are needed, which are acquired and honed over the years. But behind them is something fundamental. More important than management. More business. These are the qualities of your personality. They lead to the champion epithets "first", "best" and "most" in any case. They help to go to the goals and achieve success.
